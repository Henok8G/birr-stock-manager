# Birr Stock Manager

Birr Stock Manager is a modern web-based inventory and sales management system designed for restaurants and small businesses to track drink products, stock movement, and daily sales using Ethiopian Birr (ETB).

The system focuses on clarity, accuracy, and real-world flexibility — including support for negative stock — while keeping the interface simple, professional, and easy to use.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

Birr Stock Manager is built as an **internal management system**, not a public-facing restaurant website.  
There are **no promotions, discounts, combos, barcode scanning, or expiry tracking** — only the features needed for accurate stock and sales control.

The system intentionally allows **negative stock** to reflect real-world operations and shortages, while making those situations highly visible.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (High-Level)

- **Frontend:** Vite-based modern frontend stack
- **Backend:** Application logic implemented by the developer
- **Database:** Structured relational data models
- **Authentication:** Email & password (stored securely)
- **Reports:** PDF generation
- **Deployment:** Vercel

> Note: While Lovable AI was used during early scaffolding, the majority of the system logic, structure, and implementation was custom-built.
